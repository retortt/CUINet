This repository is for the upcoming release of our camouflaged object detection method described in the paper:

**"A Camouflaged Object Detection Method Based on Cross-modal Unidirectional Injection Fusion"**


The source code, pre-trained models, and evaluation scripts are **not yet publicly available**. We plan to release the full codebase **after the paper is officially accepted and published**.
